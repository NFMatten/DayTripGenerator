Setup<br />
Start coding the program first by going from the top of the user stories and working down. Decide how you will:<br />
    a) Store the trip options for destinations, restaurants, transportation, and entertainment each in their own List (this would be good to place at the top of the file)<br />
    b) Get a random element from each of those sets of options. We recommend declaring variables for a random destination, restaurant, transportation, and entertainment<br />
    c) Display the initial random trip to your user<br />
    d) Prompt the user to see if they are satisfied<br />
    e) If not, find out which trip feature they want to change and randomly select a new feature.<br />
    f) Keep doing this process until the user is satisfied with the trip<br />
    g) Display the completed trip to the console.<br />
